* SETUP *
*********

Please run setup_env_apt.sh before other installation scripts. This script will
install packages necessary for the emulation environments, graphing scripts,
and building the DTN source.


*******************
* Install Modules *
*******************

Each module has a separate install-*.sh script. Some modules do depend on
others to run using the scripts in the xcn directory. For example, both NS3 and
EMANE require CORE.
